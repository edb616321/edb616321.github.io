<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this repository

This repository will include the following Hugo related technologies. 

- Templating
- Site structure and Markdown.
- Core Hugo server commands and scripts.
- Html, CSS, Javascript, variables, functions
- Basic **Terraform** and **Ansible** scripting. 

There are many advantages of Static site generators such as Hugo. Development speed and site performance are two major benefits. I will be discussing these in more detail as I build the site further. 

This site was built with Hugo and is hosted on github pages.
