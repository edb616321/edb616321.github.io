My name is Edward Brookman and I love all things DevOps and Cloud. Understanding web technologies at ALL levels is important for any DevOps Engineer. Installing, configuring, automating and managing web based projects is a must-have skill set. Hugo is a site generater that utilizes many technogolies. Golang, Html, CSS, Javascript, Markdown just to mention a few. 

This is an ongoing project to increase my skills with static site generators. This is my first attempt at creating a Theme/site. I decided to build my own site instead of using a Hugo theme. 

I will continue to improve the site with time.
